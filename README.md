# WordPress.org Plugin Deploy

> Deploy your plugin to the WordPress.org repository using GitHub Actions.

[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/blob/develop/LICENSE)

This Action commits the contents of your Git tag to the WordPress.org plugin repository using the same tag name. It can exclude files as defined in either `.distignore` or `.gitattributes`, and moves anything from a `.wordpress-org` subdirectory to the top-level `assets` directory in Subversion (plugin banners, icons, and screenshots).

### ☞ For updating the readme and items in the assets directory between releases, please see our [WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update)

### ☞ Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)

## Configuration

### Required secrets
* `SVN_USERNAME`
* `SVN_PASSWORD`

[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.

### Optional environment variables
* `SLUG` - defaults to the repository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.
* `VERSION` - defaults to the tag name; do not recommend setting this except for testing purposes.
* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`).
* `BUILD_DIR` - defaults to `false`. Set this flag to the directory where you build your plugins files into, then the action will copy and deploy files from that directory. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. The relative path if provided will be concatenated with the repository root directory. All files and folders in the build directory will be deployed, `.disignore` or `.gitattributes` will be ignored.

### Inputs
* `generate-zip` - Generate a ZIP file from the SVN `trunk` directory. Outputs a `zip-path` variable for use in further workflow steps. Defaults to false.

### Outputs
* `zip-path` - The path to the ZIP file generated if `generate-zip` is set to `true`. Fully qualified including the filename, intended for use in further workflow steps such as uploading release assets.

## Excluding files from deployment
If there are files or directories to be excluded from deployment, such as tests or editor config files, they can be specified in either a `.distignore` file or a `.gitattributes` file using the `export-ignore` directive. If a `.distignore` file is present, it will be used; if not, the Action will look for a `.gitattributes` file and barring that, will write a basic temporary `.gitattributes` into place before proceeding so that no Git/GitHub-specific files are included.

`.distignore` is useful particularly when there are built files that are in `.gitignore`, and is a file that is used in [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/). For modern plugin setups with a build step and no built files committed to the repository, this is the way forward. `.gitattributes` is useful for plugins that don't run a build step as a part of the Actions workflow and also allows for GitHub's generated ZIP files to contain the same contents as what is committed to WordPress.org. If you would like to attach a ZIP file with the proper contents that decompresses to a folder name without version number as WordPress generally expects, you can add steps to your workflow that generate the ZIP and attach it to the GitHub release (concrete examples to come).

### Sample baseline files

#### `.distignore`

**Notes:** `.distignore` is for files to be ignored **only**; it does not currently allow negation like `.gitignore`. This comes from its current expected syntax in WP-CLI's [`wp dist-archive` command](https://github.com/wp-cli/dist-archive-command/). It is possible that this Action will allow for includes via something like a `.distinclude` file in the future, or that WP-CLI itself makes a change that this Action will reflect for consistency. It also will need to contain more than `.gitattributes` because that method **also** respects `.gitignore`.

```
/.wordpress-org
/.git
/.github
/node_modules

.distignore
.gitignore
```

#### `.gitattributes`

```gitattributes
# Directories
/.wordpress-org export-ignore
/.github export-ignore

# Files
/.gitattributes export-ignore
/.gitignore export-ignore
```


## Example Workflow Files

To get started, you will want to copy the contents of one of these examples into `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and push that to your repository. You are welcome to name the file something else, but it must be in that directory. The usage of `ubuntu-latest` is recommended for compatibility with required dependencies in this Action.

### Deploy on pushing a new tag

```yml
name: Deploy to WordPress.org
on:
  push:
    tags:
    - "*"
jobs:
  tag:
    name: New tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Build # Remove or modify this step as needed
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
    - name: WordPress Plugin Deploy
      uses: 10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy@stable
      env:
        SVN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SVN_PASSWORD }}
        SVN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SVN_USERNAME }}
        SLUG: my-super-cool-plugin # optional, remove if GitHub repo name matches SVN slug, including capitalization
```

### Deploy on publishing a new release and attach a ZIP file to the release
```yml
name: Deploy to WordPress.org
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  tag:
    name: New release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
    - name: WordPress Plugin Deploy
      id: deploy
      uses: 10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy@stable
      with:
        generate-zip: true
      env:
        SVN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SVN_USERNAME }}
        SVN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SVN_PASSWORD }}
    - name: Upload release asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        upload_url: ${{ github.event.release.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.zip-path }}
        asset_name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}.zip
        asset_content_type: application/zip
```
