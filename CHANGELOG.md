# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased] - TBD

## [2.0.0] - 2021-08-16
This is now a composite Action, meaning that it runs directly on the GitHub Actions runner rather than spinning up its own container and is significantly faster.

### Added
- Add `zip-path` output, as the `SLUG` may not match the repository name. Props [@ocean90](https://github.com/ocean90) via [#74](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/74).

### Fixed
- Avoid a Debian image issue where the container could not be built. Props [@helen](https://github.com/helen) via [#74](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/74).

## [1.5.0] - 2020-05-27
### Added
- Add optional ZIP file generation from SVN trunk to match content on WordPress.org. Props [@shivapoudel](https://github.com/shivapoudel) via [#37](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/37).
- Add example workflow file to attach the ZIP file to a GitHub release. Props [@helen](https://github.com/helen) via [#42](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/42).
- Set mime types on images in the SVN `assets` directory to prevent forced downloads on WordPress.org. Props [@nextgenthemes](https://github.com/nextgenthemes) via [#40](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/40).

## [1.4.1] - 2020-03-12
### Fixed
- Ensure previously committed files that are later added to `.distignore` get deleted. Props [@pascalknecht](https://github.com/pascalknecht) via [#26](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/26).
- Escape filenames to avoid errors with filenames containing an `@` symbol. Props [@Gaya](https://github.com/Gaya) via [#22](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/22).
- Use parameter expansion instead of `sed` to remove `v` from version numbers. Props [@szepeviktor](https://github.com/szepeviktor) via [#24](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/24).
- Use `https` for WordPress.org URLs. Props [@dinhtungdu](https://github.com/dinhtungdu) via [#28](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/28).
- Correct encrypted secrets documentation link. Props [@felipeelia](https://github.com/felipeelia) via [#20](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/20).

## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-21
### Added
- Strip leading `v` off of tag name if present, as it is remains common practice with Git tags.

### Fixed
- Avoid failure if no assets directory exists.

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-30
### Added
- Added the ability to use `.distignore` to exclude files from deployment instead of `.gitattributes`, which works better when a build step is included. Props [@LeoColomb](https://github.com/LeoColomb) via [#3](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/3), with additional thanks to [@markjaquith](https://github.com/markjaquith) for consultation.

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary `GITHUB_TOKEN` check/requirement.

## [1.2.1] - 2019-08-22
### Fixed
- Use more robust method of copying files (`-c` flag for `rsync`).
