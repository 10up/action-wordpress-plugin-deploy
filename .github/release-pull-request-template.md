- [x] Branch: Starting from `develop`, cut a release branch named `release/X.Y.Z` for your changes.
- [ ] Changelog: Add/update the changelog in `CHANGELOG.md`. 
- [ ] Props: update `CREDITS.md` file with any new contributors, confirm maintainers are accurate.
- [ ] Readme updates: Make any other readme changes as necessary in `README.md`.
- [ ] Merge: Make a non-fast-forward merge from your release branch to `develop` (or merge the pull request), then merge `develop` into `stable` (`git checkout stable && git merge --no-ff develop`).

- [ ] Release: Create a [new release](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/releases/new), naming the tag and the release with the new version number, and targeting the `stable` branch. Paste the changelog from `CHANGELOG.md` into the body of the release and include a link to the closed issues on the [milestone](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/milestones/#?closed=1).  The release should now appear under [releases](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/releases).

- [ ] Punt incomplete items: If any open issues or PRs which were milestoned for `X.Y.Z` do not make it into the release, update their milestone to `X.Y.Z+1`, `X.Y+- [ ]0`, `X+- [ ]0.0` or `Future Release`.
- [ ] Celebrate shipping!
